            Here are some of the issues I have with the Gregorian Calendar that
            led me to work on this proposal:

          <p>
            Neither the length of a common year (365 days) nor a leap year (366
            days) are divisible by seven, because of that the days of the week
            are not fixed with regard to the day of the month. Because of that,
            there are actually 14 different year layouts in the Gregorian
            Calendar. If I’d ask you which day of the week the 14ᵗʰ June 2027
            is, chances are you’ll have no idea. There are methods to do that
            calculation in your head (for example
            <a
              rel="noopener"

              Doomsday rule
            </a>
            ) but it’s certainly not easy. Weeks are technically not even part
            of the Gregorian Calendar but are actually overlaid onto it. SAC13
            fixes that by using one eight-day week a year (two on leap years).

            The start of the year is completely arbitrary
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are people who think that New Year happens at the end of
            December because of the winter solstice, but that’s not true.
            December solstice typically happens around the 21ˢᵗ so about 10
            days before New Year. For a very long time the year started with
            March, until the Romans changed it for political and tactical
            reasons in
            <a
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1">
              153 BC
            </a>
            . A modern calendar shouldn’t start the year at a practically random
            point just because Roman consuls took office around that time of
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The start of the year should be deliberate and something important
            for most cultures and that’s why SAC13 starts the year with the
            March equinox. The start of the year doesn’t have to be the March
            equinox to be a good calendar, but there should be good and valid
            reasons for picking that specific point in time to be the start of
            the year.

            Over the course of a year there are several interesting points the
            Earth passes on its orbit around the sun.

          </p>
          <p>
            Because the December solstice is currently around of December 21 and
            the next year begins 10 days later, the Gregorian Calendar is
            misaligned by roughly 10 days with the astronomical seasons. This
            leads to a situation where a lot of data and diagrams are ever so
            slightly shifted and asymmetrical.

            The names of the months are shifted
          </h2>
          <p>
            The last four months got their name from Latin: September (
            <em>septem</em>
            , seven), October (
            <em>octo</em>
            , eight), November (
            <em>novem</em>
            , nine), December (
            <em>decem</em>
            , ten). But those numbers no longer reflect the positions they are
            in. Originally those months were supposedly part of a ten month
            Roman calendar when they switched to a twelve month calendar they
            added two months at the bottom (doesn’t cause any issues), but
            political changes in
            <a
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1">
              153 BC
            </a>
            caused more and more people to see January as the start of the year,
            which caused those numbered months to be in the wrong place.
          </p>
          <h2 id="calendar-drift">Calendar drift</h2>
          <p>
            The leap year rules for the Gregorian Calendar average to a year
            length of 365.2425 days, but in reality it’s a bit shorter than
            that, which causes the Gregorian Calendar to drift ever so slightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be fair, in practice that’s probably a small issue, because the
            current drift is slow enough, that we can plan centuries ahead of
            time to skip specific leap years. For example we could decide (and
            slowly update todays software) that the year 2600 won’t be a leap
            year (I just picked that year at random). We could keep everything
            the same and we’d have about 600 years to make sure all our systems
            know about that exception, which would certainly be more than enough
            given the fact that we already have and do solve other
            <a

            all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could also just accept, that the calendar is drifting, because
            it’s so slow that it might not even be an issue at all for future
            generations on to have winter in the northern hemisphere in July.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>But!</strong>
            , because we already change the calendar, so why not fix that too?
          </p>
          <h2 id="shifted-millennia">Shifted millennia</h2>
          <p>
            Because the Gregorian Calendar doesn’t have a year zero, the
            millennia are offset by one year with respect to the thousands place
            of the year. The year 1999 is part of the 2nd millennium (AD), 2000
            was also in the second millennium and and 2001 was the start of the
            3rd millennium. More about how SAC13 fixes that here:
