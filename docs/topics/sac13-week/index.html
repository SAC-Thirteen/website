          <h1 id="why-seven-day-weeks">Why seven day weeks?</h1>
          <p>
            Very large parts of the world, economy, businesses, cultures and
            religions evolved with the seven-day week for literally thousands of
            years. Changing to a different calendar system is already a massive
            undertaking. Attempting to change the typical length of the week
            cycle is pretty much impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of our day to day lives are typically closely linked to the
            week cycle. Which days you go to work or school and which days you
            don’t. Even if you are working different shifts, you are probably
            thinking about your shifts in terms of the week cycle. For example
            if the next shift is a weekend shift or not. Chances are most of the
            things you do multiple times per month on a schedule, are scheduled
            with respect to the week cycle. Very rarely is something scheduled
            to always be on the 4<sup class="ord">th</sup> of a month; it’s typically something like
            “every Monday”, “every 1<sup class="ord">st</sup> Wednesday of the month”, or “every
            2<sup class="ord">nd</sup> Friday”, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the reason why calendars where the typical week length
            is not seven will never be adopted, because the schedules are so
            different that those calendars couldn’t be used in parallel with the
            Gregorian Calendar.
          </p>
          <h1 id="breaking-the-week-cycle">Breaking the week cycle</h1>
          <p>
            So why does SAC13 break the week cycle, then, if it’s so important?
            Because every alternative would result in a worse calendar for most
            people. The alternative would either not have a fixed layout, which
            is so important that it is the only thing all calendar proposals
            agree on. Or not have a solar calendar, and intentionally allow
            calendar drift. To my knowledge, nobody seriously suggested that
            yet. Or to use <a href="/topics/leap-weeks/">leap weeks</a>, which
            come with a whole lot of other issues like high year length
            variability, sometimes a different number of months, or vastly
            different month lengths like in the Symmetry454 calendar where some
            months are 28 days and some are 35 days.
          </p>
          <h2 id="why-do-we-even-need-weekdays">
            Why do we even need weekdays?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We need weekdays because the currently established calendar system
            is not one calendar, but actually two. The Gregorian Calendar, which
            defines months, their length, and leap year rule, and a technically
            completely separate “calendar” that existed long before the
            Gregorian Calendar: A repeating cycle of seven-day weeks. Those
            weeks actually don’t have anything to do with the Gregorian Calendar
            itself, they are just overlaid on top of it. This is also why it’s
            not easily possible to determine the weekday for a given date (if
            you are not into
            <a
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule"
              >mental gymnastics</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our day to day lives happen with respect to the week cycle and long
            term things are planned with the Gregorian Calendar. That’s why we
            need Weekday names, because if I’d just write “16<sup class="ord">th</sup> April 2017”,
            would you know if it was on a weekend or not? Chances are, you have
            no idea. It was a Wednesday, but that additional information was
            only needed because the Gregorian Calendar and the week cycle are
            two different systems used in parallel.
          </p>
          <h2 id="no-names-vs-new-names">No names vs new names</h2>
          <p>
            The reason SAC13 doesn’t use the traditional weekday names (Monday,
            Tuesday, etc.) is that it uses sync days to synchronize the calendar
            and to fix its weekdays. This causes SAC13’s weeks to drift against
            the strict seven day week cycle used with the Gregorian Calendar. If
            SAC13 used the same names, days would have (most of time) different
            weekdays in SAC13 and the Gregorian Calendar. A Tuesday in SAC13
            might be a Sunday in the Gregorian Calendar. There are only two
            solutions to that: either using new weekday names or dropping them
            entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with coming up with new weekday names is that it’s hard
            to find something most people like, is translatable into many
            languages and doesn’t favor a specific culture, region or language.
            I thought about it a lot and came to the conclusion to just refer to
            them descriptively, like “3<sup class="ord">rd</sup> Weekday”, “Weekday Three”, or “D3”.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned in the Introduction, it’s pretty simple to determine
            the day of the week in SAC13 for any day. Simply find the previous
            multiple of seven and take the difference. For example, for the
            24<sup class="ord">th</sup>, find the last multiple of seven (21<sup class="ord">st</sup>), take the
            difference (3), so it’s the 3<sup class="ord">rd</sup> day of the week, “Weekday Three”
            or “D3”.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t possible in the Gregorian Calendar; that’s why weekday
            names are pretty helpful there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point I wanted to make is, that in the Gregorian Calendar a date
            doesn’t tell you if it’s a business day or weekend (unless you very
            <a
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule"
              >good at some mental gymnastics</a
            >). With SAC13 you don’t need that. You don’t even need a date. The
            year doesn’t matter, the month doesn’t matter, just the day of the
            month. It couldn’t be any easier.
