            The tropical year is a bit longer than 365 days.
            <a href="/tech/calendar-layouts/">Coincidentally</a> 364 (with its
            prime factors 2, 2, 7, 13) is divisible by seven, the length of a
            week and also by four, to get quarters. Many calendar proposals
            (including SAC13) are built around that 364 day year, because it
            allows for especially simple and pretty calendar layouts. But a year
            is longer than 364 days, so unless we want the calendar to drift a
            lot, we have to somehow cram in a day (or two on leap years) but
            without ruining too much of the pretty layout we got by designing
            around 364 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some calendar proposals (e.g., International Fixed Calendar,
            Positivist calendar, World Calendar) try to fix that by defining
            those intercalated days to be outside of any month and week with no
            ordinal number. At a quick glance it might look like a good idea,
            because defining them outside of weeks and months allows the rest of
            the calendar to be extra pretty because there is never a 29<sup class="ord">th</sup> of
            anything. Some proponents of such calendars even claim that they
            don’t break the week cycle because those days are outside of weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you think about it, it’s not a good idea at all. It’s like
            children “cleaning up” their room by sweeping everything under the
            bed and then defining “under the bed” as somehow outside of the
            room. It’s also bad because, between the years those calendars were
            proposed and today, computers happened. It would be a nightmare of
            edge cases to define those days outside of months and weeks, and
            without ordinal numbers. What would the calendar on your smartphone
            look like on or around that day? It’s not impossible but it’s
            impractical and unnecessarily complicated. What would an
            ISO-8601-like date format look like for that day?
            <code>2000-06-27</code>, <code>2000-06-28</code>,
            <code>2000-LeapDay</code>, <code>2000-07-01</code>? How would an
            accountant type that on their Numpad? It would also be completely
            undefined which period to attribute stuff to, that happens on a Leap
            Day or Year Day. If you use electricity on that day, is that billed
            in the previous month or the next month? Or do you get a separate
            bill just for Leap Days? So, in practice the Leap Day and Year Day
            will always be considered part of a week or month, but if the
            calendar system defines them to be somehow outside of weeks and
            months, everybody will just start doing their own thing (like using
            <code>2000-06-29</code> or <code>2000-07-00</code> instead of
            <code>2000-LeapDay</code>) and the mess would be perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            SAC13 takes a more honest approach. The reason why we have those
            sync days is because we want to sync up the calendar with reality,
            and to make sure everybody agrees on where to attribute stuff to
            that happens on sync days. They have a clearly defined week, month,
            and ordinal number. Of course it’s still an edge case, but a fairly
            trivial one and most importantly: There is no ambiguity and
            everybody agrees on how to handle it.
