          <h3 id="but-there-is-a-catch-right">But there is a catch, right?</h3>
          <p>
            Kind of. Because 28 days × 13 months is only 364 days, we are
            missing a day in a common year and two days in a leap year to get to
            365 and 366, respectively. To fix that discrepancy SAC13 uses
            <em>synchronization days</em> (or sync days for short) to keep the
            calendar in sync with Earth’s motion around the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sync days are, unlike in other 13-month calendar proposals, not
            unnamed <a href="/topics/blank-days/">“blank” days</a> but are part
            of a specific week, month and quarter, and have regular ordinals
            like all the other dates. If there is a sync day, it’s added to the
            end of the month as the 29^th^, and it belongs to the last week of
            that month. Those eight day weeks are called <em>long weeks</em> or
            <em>sync weeks</em> and have a three day
            <a href="/topics/sac13-week/">weekend</a>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Every year ends with a sync day:</strong><br />
                <em>29^th^ Addenduary</em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>On leap years, August has a sync day too:</strong><br />
                <em>29^th^ August</em>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It’s fair game to call them <em>Year Day</em> and
            <em>Leap Day</em> if you want, but keep in mind that it’s similar to
            calling 14^th^ February <em>Valentine’s Day</em>. Other people
            probably know which day you mean, but those are not formally
            recognized names for the day.

            Here is the entire layout for a year, including the sync days. The

          <h2 id="leap-years">Leap years</h2>
          <p>
            Every four or five years SAC13 has a leap year to ensure that the
            start of the year stays close to the March equinox. This is done
            algorithmically - not through observation - as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Take the year and add 199</li>
            <li>
              Divide that by 293 and continue with the remainder (mod 293)
            </li>
            <li>Divide that by 33 and continue with the remainder (mod 33)</li>
            <li>Divide that by 4 and continue with the remainder (mod 4)</li>
            <li>If the result is 1 it’s a leap year</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Why those exact magic numbers, technical details, and why I think
            it’s okay that you can’t do that in your head

          <h2 id="no-weekday-names">No weekday names</h2>
          <p>
            SAC13 doesn’t have official names for the weekdays but formally
            recognizes only weekday ordinals like “1^st^ weekday”, “2^nd^
            weekday”, and so on. Because all months have a fixed layout, the day
            of the week is completely determined by the day of the month.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the day of the week in SAC13 for any day, find the
            previous multiple of seven and take the difference. For example to
            find the day of the week for the 24^th^, find the last multiple of
            seven (21^st^), take the difference (3), so it’s the 3^rd^ day of
            the week, “Weekday Three” or “D3”. Note however, this does not tell
            you the Gregorian Calendar day of the week.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important that you don’t use “Monday” instead of “D1” - those
            are not synonyms. If you use SAC13 and the Gregorian Calendar in
            parallel, you can, of course, use “Monday” - but only if that date
            really is a Monday on the Gregorian Calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you want more details on SAC13 weekdays and why they don’t need
            names? Take a look here:

            SAC13 is anchored with the closest day to the March equinox in the
            Gregorian year 2000:
          </p>
          <p>
            $$ \boxed{ \begin{array}{r:rlr} \text{SAC13} &amp; 1^{\text{st}}
            &amp;\negthickspace\negthickspace\text{March}\ &amp;
            \negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\text{M000}\newline
            \text{Greg.C.} &amp; 20^{\text{th}}

            \negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\negthickspace\text{2000}\newline
            \text{JDN} &amp; &amp;\negthickspace\negthickspace{}2451624 &amp;
            \end{array} } $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though this date equality was originally used to develop the
            technical details of SAC13, like the leap year rule, it has actually
            low technical significance, because for the actual software
            implementations this equality is projected backward to a different
            starting point. It really could have been any other year, but I
            chose the Gregorian year 2000 as an example and original starting
            point, because it’s fairly recent so people can relate to it, and
            it’s a nice round number. If you are interested in different dates,

              Fixed layout. Every Month. Not only from year to year, or quarter

              Stupidly simple layout, 7 × 4. Sometimes there is an additional

            <li>All weeks, months, years start with the same weekday (D1).</li>
            <li>
              Months and quarters are more comparable than in other calendars
              because, they have at most a single extra day.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are no negative years. This simplifies historical dates and
              correct software implementations.
            </li>
            <li>
              It doesn’t have
              <a href="/topics/blank-days/">“blank” days</a> “outside” the
              calendar, like other 13 month proposals.
            </li>
            <li>
              The calendar layout, documentation and it’s reference
              implementation in various programming languages is in the public
              domain (CC0).

          <h1 id="downsides">Downsides</h1>
          <p>
            Every calendar has downsides — even SAC13 😂. The only difference is
            that this proposal is also honest and transparent about that. Maybe
            even the only proposal that does that. Calendars have many
            conflicting requirements (or “nice to have“s) which directly
            contradict each other, so it’s always a trade-off about what’s most
            useful and important and which downsides are acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding a good calendar design is basically a process of choosing
            the downsides in a way that trying to fix any of them would create
            even bigger issues and a worse calendar for most people. Here are
            the downsides SAC13 intentionally chooses to accept as trade-offs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              SAC13 will (once or twice a year) have a week with an additional
              day, to keep the calendar in sync with the solar system, and thus
              fall out of sync with the “Gregorian Week”. This is also called
              <a href="/topics/sac13-week/">breaking the week cycle</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Years of this calendar are not congruent with the Gregorian
              Calendar. SAC13’s New Year is roughly 2½ months after the
              Gregorian New Year.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a href="/tech/leap-year-rule/">leap year rule</a> is more
              complicated than in the Gregorian Calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/topics/sac13-quarter/">Quarters</a> are not aligned with
              whole months, but only weeks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here are additional downsides that are not trade-offs, but are
            unavoidable consequences of switching to a new calendar system. All
            calendar proposals (incl. SAC13) share those:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Switching to a new calendar (especially on a large scale, like
              globally) is
              <a href="/topics/cost-and-effort/"
                >unimaginably expensive and a huge effort</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              All
              <a href="/topics/different-dates/">dates will be different</a>.
              Anniversaries, wedding dates and birthdays, Halloween 🎃, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Ready to go down the rabbit hole? These were just the basics about
            SAC13. If you’d like to know more about the reasons behind the
